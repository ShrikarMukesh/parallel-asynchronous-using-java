1. Thread : A Thread is a very light-weighted process, or we can say the smallest part of the process that allows a 
           program to operate more efficiently by running multiple tasks simultaneously.
2. Thread Pool:
3. Executor Service: The Java ExecutorService is the interface which allows us to execute tasks on threads asynchronously.
4. Runnable: A runnable interface in Java is an interface whose instances can run as a Thread. While working with Threads, the runnable interface acts as a core element of the Java programming language. 
             Java classes created to run Threads must implement this interface.
5. Callable: A task that returns a result and may throw an exception. Implementors define a single method with no arguments called call. 
             The Callable interface is similar to Runnable , in that both are designed for classes whose instances are potentially executed by another thread.
6. Future: A Future represents the result of an asynchronous computation. 
       Methods are provided to check if the computation is complete, to wait for its completion, and to retrieve the result of the computation.
7. CompletableFuture:
